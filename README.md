This repository is a collection of code source I wrote for my work on user matching in social networks. It consists of three folders for Qora, Twitter, and account matching.

## Qora Crawler
This is working as per 2019-03-15. 
Please note that Qora does change the layout/structure of its website every now and then. So please update the code in case it doesn't work as expected.
## Twitter Crawler

## Matching
