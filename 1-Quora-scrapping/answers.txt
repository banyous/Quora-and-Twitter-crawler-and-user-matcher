Are you kidding me? Yes, you heard me right. Ok, let’s get to the point. It’s said that about 51% of internet traffic is caused by bots. Remember that weird “I am not a robot” check box that we get on many websites? These bots are the primary reason for that.2) Robots started to get citizenship!On October 25th 2017, Sophia the robot was granted Saudi Arabian citizenship. Humans are struggling to be accepted as nationals in some parts of world, and robots are starting to get it already!3) Most AI assistants are femaleHave you noticed that most AI assistants are females? From Siri and Google assistant to Cortana and Alexa, most of them are females. Ever wonder why? It’s because studies have shown that people prefer female voices over male voices (both men and women prefer female voices).4) Your smartphone is a million times more powerful than the computers NASA used for launching Apollo 11The computers used to guide humans through space, about 356,000km away from earth, were a million times less powerful than the smartphone in your hand right now. Just imagine the potential we have got.5) The worlds most expensive food bought was 2 Papa John’s pizzasDon't believe me? Let me explain:The first bitcoin ever spent was used to buy 2 pizzas by a man named Hanyecz from Florida. He bought the pizza for 10,000 bitcoins, which was just 30$ then, but would be worth millions of dollars now.If you want to know more: 49 interesting Tech facts for 2020 that will blow your mindEvery upvote will motivate me to write more interesting answers!THANK YOU

Is-Verizon-still-CDMA-with-5G	2020-03-01	Dave-Haynie	['Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)', 'Verizon', 'Verizon Wireless', '5G (wireless communication)', 'Telecommunications', 'Wireless Technology', 'Cellular Service Providers']	CDMA actually has two slightly different meanings. Both are “no” for 5G-NR all by itself.If you're using “CDMA" as a short name for Qualcomm's CDMA2000™ technology, the 3G cellular standard used in the USA by Verizon and Sprint, then certainly, Verizon is not using a 3G technology for 5G. In fact, Verizon uses the worldwide LTE standard for 4G, and the worldwide 5G-NR standard for 5G. It has been over a year since you could add a new CDMA2000™ device to a Verizon network, and they intend to sunset that network after December 31, 2020.If you mean “code-division multiple access,” the channel-sharing technology used by CDMA2000, the answer is the same, but that's a bit more complex. Verizon and Sprint also used Qualcomm's proprietary IS-95 technology for their 2G networks, is also based on CDMA. The GSM standard for 2G used two alternatives, frequency-division multiple access (FDMA) and time-division multiple access (TDMA). However, when the 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project) rolled out the 3G technologies for GSM systems, they also used a version of CDMA. Basically, 3G was all CDMA, but the two systems were still incompatible. Only Qualcomm was using CDMA™.Ok, so here’s a thing to understand in these acronyms. The smartphone industry likes to call these things “xxMA”, where MA = Multiple Access. Most engineers in other fields, including all the WiFi guys, call this M = Multiplexing. They’re the same thing… the idea is that you have to share the same radio frequencies between multiple devices. WiFi uses the same channel for downlink and uplink between access point and device. All cellular technologies use one channel for tower-to-phone and one for phone-to-tower. But they’re always designed to send data to multiple phones on the same channel, or receive data from multiple phones on the same channel. So there has to be a technology that permits this kind of sharing, or multiplexing, of the channel.Long-Term Evolution (LTE) was the overwhelming winner among 4G technologies, and is used by most carriers, including all of the US carriers. LTE uses orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) for tower to phone transmission and SC-FDMA (aka, pre-coded OFDM) for the phone to tower transmission. OFDM has a high PAPR (peak to average power), meaning that transmitters have to have pretty high output power to meet the peak output, but on average, that extra power consumption is a waste. On the phone side of things, a lower peak output power on transmit using SC-FDMA was a winning tradeoff for a more complex level of digital preprocessing of the signal. This is in part why early LTE phones used more power than 3G phones, but over time, they’ve evolved to use much less for the same data transferred.The 5G-NR radio is using new versions of OFDMA. Again, the downlink and uplink are different. The 5G-NR tower to phone modulation is called Cyclic-Prefix Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (CP-OFDM) waveform for downlink transmissions. This is only a slight tweak of the LTE protocol. Most of the increases in speeds for 5G-NR come from using much wider bandwidths, much as WiFi has boosted speed not only via protocol improvements, but moving from 20MHz to 40, 80, and 160MHz channel bandwidths. This is the primary reason that 5G-NR, while it’s already being unrolled at classic cellular frequencies (T-Mobile’s big 5G-NR push is on 600MHz, LTE Channel 71), it’s the >6GHz bands that offer a huge amount of currently available bandwidth.For the uplink, they’re using Discrete Fourier Transform Spread Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (DFT-s-OFDM). Curiously enough, while you’ll see this mentioned all over the 5G-NR articles, it’s basically just another name for SC-FDMA. As in the downlink, the uplink for 5G-NR is an evolution of LTE, not a wholly new thing.Read MoreDIfference between OFDM and CDMAOFDM & Modulation " Electronics Notes

Is-Verizon-still-CDMA-with-5G	2020-03-01	Dave-Haynie	['Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)', 'Verizon', 'Verizon Wireless', '5G (wireless communication)', 'Telecommunications', 'Wireless Technology', 'Cellular Service Providers']	CDMA actually has two slightly different meanings. Both are “no” for 5G-NR all by itself.If you're using “CDMA" as a short name for Qualcomm's CDMA2000™ technology, the 3G cellular standard used in the USA by Verizon and Sprint, then certainly, Verizon is not using a 3G technology for 5G. In fact, Verizon uses the worldwide LTE standard for 4G, and the worldwide 5G-NR standard for 5G. It has been over a year since you could add a new CDMA2000™ device to a Verizon network, and they intend to sunset that network after December 31, 2020.If you mean “code-division multiple access,” the channel-sharing technology used by CDMA2000, the answer is the same, but that's a bit more complex. Verizon and Sprint also used Qualcomm's proprietary IS-95 technology for their 2G networks, is also based on CDMA. The GSM standard for 2G used two alternatives, frequency-division multiple access (FDMA) and time-division multiple access (TDMA). However, when the 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project) rolled out the 3G technologies for GSM systems, they also used a version of CDMA. Basically, 3G was all CDMA, but the two systems were still incompatible. Only Qualcomm was using CDMA™.Ok, so here’s a thing to understand in these acronyms. The smartphone industry likes to call these things “xxMA”, where MA = Multiple Access. Most engineers in other fields, including all the WiFi guys, call this M = Multiplexing. They’re the same thing… the idea is that you have to share the same radio frequencies between multiple devices. WiFi uses the same channel for downlink and uplink between access point and device. All cellular technologies use one channel for tower-to-phone and one for phone-to-tower. But they’re always designed to send data to multiple phones on the same channel, or receive data from multiple phones on the same channel. So there has to be a technology that permits this kind of sharing, or multiplexing, of the channel.Long-Term Evolution (LTE) was the overwhelming winner among 4G technologies, and is used by most carriers, including all of the US carriers. LTE uses orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) for tower to phone transmission and SC-FDMA (aka, pre-coded OFDM) for the phone to tower transmission. OFDM has a high PAPR (peak to average power), meaning that transmitters have to have pretty high output power to meet the peak output, but on average, that extra power consumption is a waste. On the phone side of things, a lower peak output power on transmit using SC-FDMA was a winning tradeoff for a more complex level of digital preprocessing of the signal. This is in part why early LTE phones used more power than 3G phones, but over time, they’ve evolved to use much less for the same data transferred.The 5G-NR radio is using new versions of OFDMA. Again, the downlink and uplink are different. The 5G-NR tower to phone modulation is called Cyclic-Prefix Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (CP-OFDM) waveform for downlink transmissions. This is only a slight tweak of the LTE protocol. Most of the increases in speeds for 5G-NR come from using much wider bandwidths, much as WiFi has boosted speed not only via protocol improvements, but moving from 20MHz to 40, 80, and 160MHz channel bandwidths. This is the primary reason that 5G-NR, while it’s already being unrolled at classic cellular frequencies (T-Mobile’s big 5G-NR push is on 600MHz, LTE Channel 71), it’s the >6GHz bands that offer a huge amount of currently available bandwidth.For the uplink, they’re using Discrete Fourier Transform Spread Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (DFT-s-OFDM). Curiously enough, while you’ll see this mentioned all over the 5G-NR articles, it’s basically just another name for SC-FDMA. As in the downlink, the uplink for 5G-NR is an evolution of LTE, not a wholly new thing.Read MoreDIfference between OFDM and CDMAOFDM & Modulation " Electronics Notes
